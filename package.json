```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
// This import will cause the test to fail initially because the 'App.tsx' component
// (a typical main application component in a Vite React project) does not yet exist.
import App from './App';

describe('Project Initialization Verification', () => {
  it('should render the default Vite + React welcome message after initialization', () => {
    // This `render` call will fail because the `App` component file is not yet created.
    // If `App.tsx` were to exist but be empty or contain different content,
    // the subsequent `getByRole` assertion would also fail, ensuring initial failure.
    render(<App />);

    // This assertion looks for the common "Vite + React" heading, which is typically present
    // in the default setup of a new Vite React project. Verifying its presence indicates
    // that the core project, including React and Vite, has been successfully initialized.
    // The test is designed to fail initially because the component doesn't exist or
    // doesn't yet contain this specific, expected content.
