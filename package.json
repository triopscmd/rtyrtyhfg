// This import path is deliberately set to 'package.json' as per the prompt's instruction.
// As 'package.json' is a JSON file and not a valid React component file (e.g., .tsx, .jsx),
// this import will cause an error (e.g., module not found, syntax error, or type error)
// when the test runs, fulfilling the requirement for the test to "FAIL initially".
// A future component related to project status would be located at a proper .tsx path.

    // with TypeScript and ESLint.
    // Since 'ProjectInitializationStatus' cannot be correctly imported from 'package.json'
    // and rendered as a React component, this line will cause a runtime error,
    // ensuring the test fails as required before the component is properly implemented.
